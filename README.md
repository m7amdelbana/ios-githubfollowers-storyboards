# Overview:

This project is a simple project using Swift programming language, I build it without VIPER architecture. I really like VIPER, but I focus at this project on using 100% programmatic UI, also I like Interface Builder and I work on it at my projects, so at this project I used code to make the UI to help who is use code to write code less by provide some useful extensions.



# App:

- The user can enter a GitHub username and retrieve a list of that username's followers.
- The user can search within these followers for a specific follower.
- The user is able to tap on a follower from that list to get more information about that follower.
